5. (10 points) Consider the following code blocks which generate the same output.
    1. (7 points) Describe what each program snippet does to compute its results.
   
```
#Approach 1
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n): res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5): 
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

Approach 1: This approach computes its results by firstly using a function called doubleL that takes an input "n" and intializes a list. Then it iterates through the range from 0 to "n-1" and multiplies each i by 2 and then adding it to the end of the list (append). Then it returns the list "res". The for loop outside the function iterates over the value  "i" returned by doubleL using an input 5 (n) and prints them using a seperator ":".


```
#Approach 2
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```

Approach 2: This approach computes its results by using a for loop that creates a list that uses the element "n * 2" for every "n < 5" since "range(5)" creates values 0 to 4. Then the loops iterates over the list and prints the elements using a seperator of ":".


```
#Approach 3
def doubleG(n):
        for i in range(n):
            yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
        print(i, end=' : ')
```

Approach 3: This approach computes its results by firstly creating a function doubleG that takes an input "n' and uses a for loop that iterates over the range(n) and uses yield to create a sequence of values. The for loop outside the function iterates over the values yielded by "doubleG(n)" where "n=5" and prints them using a seperator ":".


 2. (3 points) What type of function is `doubleG(n)`? What is the advantage of using such a function?

The `doubleG(n)` is a generator function that uses "yield" instead of "return". This function uses "yield" instead of "return" because return sends a specified value back to the caller whereas yield produces a sequence of values. Yield is used when we want to iterate over a sequece but don't want to store the entire sequence in memory. 

The advantage of this function is that it generates values one at a time and allows the "for" loop outside of the function to call this function and print the results. This is memory efficient because it does not create an entire list at once.
